# Weather Application

This is a simple weather application that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on the webpage. It also uses the Unsplash API to fetch images related to the weather description and sets them as the background of the webpage.

## Setup

1. Get API Keys:
   - Visit [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get an API key for weather data.
   - Visit [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to get an API key for fetching images.
2. Please make sure to replace `'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY'` and `'YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY'` in the `main.js` section with your actual API keys obtained from OpenWeatherMap and Unsplash, respectively. Additionally, modify other parts of the README as needed (e.g., repository URL, project name, license, etc.).

## Usage

-   Enter a city name in the search input and press Enter.
-   The application will fetch the weather data and display it on the screen.
-   If the city is not found or there's an error, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
-   The application saves the last searched city to local storage and automatically loads it on page refresh.
